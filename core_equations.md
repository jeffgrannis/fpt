# 📐 Core Equations — Fold Projection Theory (FPT)

These symbolic equations form the minimal set of mechanisms behind Fold Projection Theory. They express emergence through rhythm, projection, coherence, and recursive collapse.

> **Note**: All quantities are dimensionless. Fold-Time \( Fₜ \) is 2π-periodic:  
> ∮ₛ¹ dFₜ = 2π.  
> ℒ can be taken as a countable set (mode indices) in discrete simulations.  
> The symbol λ is used for labels; I use capital Λ for decay constants in Eq 6 to avoid confusion.

### 1. **Primitive Rhythm**
```
Ψ₀(Fₜ) = sin(Fₜ), Fₜ ∈ S¹
```
> The fundamental oscillation. Fold-Time is not linear but cyclical, forming the sole primitive rhythm of the undivided substrate.

---

### 2. **Projection Operator**
```
Πₛ : S¹ → ℒ
```
> Maps rhythmic cycles to symbolic labels. These are not spatial coordinates, but emergent identifiers such as phase, spin, or structure types.

---

### 3. **Projection Power Density**
```
Ξₚ(λ, Fₜ) = ρ₀(λ, Fₜ) · Cₘ(λ, Fₜ)
```
> Projection power is the product of rhythmic density and coherence at each label. Fold-Time dynamics modulate these values over cycles.

---

### 4. **Phase-Flow Law**
```
d/dFₜ [ρ₀(λ, Fₜ) · Cₘ(λ, Fₜ)] = –γ ρ₀(λ, Fₜ) Cₘ(λ, Fₜ) + ∑ T(λ′ → λ) · Ξₚ(λ′, Fₜ)
```
> Power flows recursively through the label space. No geometry, only rhythmic influence passing across symbolic connections.  
> *γ > 0 sets the relaxation rate (damping constant). T is non-zero only for rhythmically adjacent or resonant labels.  
> If ℒ is continuous, replace the sum with an integral: ∑ → ∫.*

---

### 5. **Observer Criterion**
```
Ξₚ > Ξ_th  and  |dCₘ(λ, Fₜ)/dFₜ| < ε  ⇒  Agent
```
> Conscious or stable agents only emerge when projection power is strong and rhythmic coherence changes slowly across Fold-Time.  
> *ε is a small tolerance value indicating coherence stability.*

---

### 6. **Harmonic Modulation**
```
M_ℓ = sin(2πℓ / Δ_ℓ) · e^(–ℓ / Λ)
```
> The foundational projection filter. It reproduces the CMB-like structure and provides rhythm-based emergence patterns across scales.  
> *(ℓ ∈ ℕ, Δ_ℓ > 0 sets the band spacing.)*

---

*Each of these expressions can be simulated or projected without assuming spacetime or classical fields. Together, they describe how fold rhythm becomes observer-reality.*
